## Autonomous Documentation

Each auto is sorted by the side of the subwoofer that our robot will start on.
Remember to check that your driver station is set to the correct alliance when enabling auto, as using the wrong alliance will flip the auto. Every auto also fires the preloaded shot immediately.

### Front Side 5P

New variant of the 4 piece auto. Likely not going to be run, but available.

### Anti Fresta

Newer auto that starts in the furthest corner toward the amp. Rushes to the center to grab valueable pieces. Grabs top piece in about 6 seconds.

### SS Podium Start

An auto that makes it personal with the enemy team. Starts in the same corner as AntiFresta, but doesn't score and knocks all the center pieces out of place.
